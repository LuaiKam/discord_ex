# DiscordElixir

Discord library for elixir. I needed it and figured I'd share.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add discord_elixir to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:discord_elixir, "~> 1.0.0"}]
        end

  2. Ensure discord_elixir is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:discord_elixir]]
        end
